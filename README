NAME
    Kwiki::Yahoo - Wafl Phrase for including RSS feeds in a Kwiki Page

DESCRIPTION
      {yahoo-doc <query> |args}

    Kwiki::Yahoo uses the Yahoo::Search module to use the Yahoo API for web,
    video, image, news, local, spelling, and related searches.

    This is a simple proof of concept that probably has many roads for
    improvement. A lot of flexibility would be gained by accessing the
    Results directly rather than using the generated HTML.

DEMONSTRATION
    There's a demonstration, with some explanatory text at
